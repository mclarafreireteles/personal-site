            <p>Since childhood, I've been fascinated by games and the inner workings of computers, especially when creating textures for the game Minecraft. Today, I have the incredible opportunity to study programming and explore the impact of <strong>user interface</strong> on digital transformation.</p>

            <p>Currently, my focus is on studying <strong>web development and UI/UX design</strong>. I believe in the potential of efficient digital solutions that understand user needs. I'm constantly seeking knowledge and challenges to enhance my skills and ensure that my projects align with the ever-evolving market demands.</p>

            <p>Outside the digital realm, I find balance and inspiration in music and the company of my dog, Apolo. Playing the drums is a passion that allows me to disconnect and recharge.</p>

            <p>Thank you for visiting my digital space and sharing a bit of my journey. I'm excited to see where our interactions will lead us! ðŸ˜Š</p>
